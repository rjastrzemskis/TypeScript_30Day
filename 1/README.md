First step as always in `npm` projects is to install dependencies by executing command `npm install`.

You can run any file by executing command `npm run ts src/echo.ts` where `src/echo.ts` is the name of your file in `src` directory. There is a sample file there `echo.ts`. To make a new console application just copy the file contents and use them as a starting point.

This application is using [`prompts` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompts), documentation is always the first place where you should look if something is unclear.
